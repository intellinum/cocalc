/*
1. Periodically pull all data from Stripe for now. The only point of this is
to ensure there isn't drift between stripe and our database. Any time a user
actually looks at their subscription info, or an admin updates the stripe info
(by 'add user to stripe' in account settings) the info is also synced. So this
is not super important.

TODO: Obviously, we should redo this to only pull maybe once per week (?) AND
also have a webhook so that any changes in stripe are immediately reflected here...

2. Periodically

This is run as a singleton deployment on some preemptible.
