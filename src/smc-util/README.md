CoCalc code shared between the frontend and the backend.

This is pure javascript code that can be used anywhere -- the backend servers, the frontend client, etc.

This code is part of https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc and isn't currently designed to be used standalone. Our plan is to refactor this code into smaller useful modules that are published under the @cocalc npm organization.
