These are from iconfont:

The steps are:

1. Make a shopping cart with a bunch of icons
2. Add them to a project
3. Download the code of a project (the js).
4. Upload the js file in that zip download here.

It should work fine to add multiple js files, since each just adds some hidden
template svg element to the DOM.  Just be sure to update `index.js` to include them.
